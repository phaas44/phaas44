### Hi there, I'm Patrick 🤖

I'm pursuing my Master's degree in Electrical and Information Technology at [ETH Zurich](www.ethz.ch) while currently engaged in an international collaboration with the Industrial Informatics Lab [ai2 Lab](www.ai2.upv.es) at [Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV)](www.upv.es) for my master's thesis.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my master thesis with the title "Developing enhanced Drone Operations: Enabling Gesture Recognition with Integration of Custom Fleet Management System based on ROOSTER". Once permitted, I'll share the publicly accessible codebase. For detailed insights, visit the [lab's website](https://www.ai2.upv.es/en/proyecto/feroxai-data-and-robotics-technologies-in-harvesting-wild-food/) and the official [project website](https://ferox.fbk.eu/).
- 🌱 Exploring the realm of computer vision and machine learning algorithms to enable gesture control functionalities on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).  
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me via email at patrick.haas97 [at] gmx.ch or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickhaas4/).
- ⚡ Fun Fact: Jogging isn't just a hobby, it's a joyous passion for me.  When I'm not hitting the pavement, you can catch me kitesurfing in a hilariously unique style.  🏃‍♂️🪁
