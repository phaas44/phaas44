### Hi there, I'm Patrick 🤖

I am a electrical and information technology master student at [ETHZ](www.ethz.ch). Currently I am working abroad on my master thesis in colaboration with the [ai2 Lab](www.ai2.upv.es) at [UPV](www.upv.es).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my master thesis with the title "Developing enhanced Drone Operations: Enabling Gesture Recognition with Integration of Custom Fleet Management System based on ROOSTER". As soon as I can, I'll upload the code base which I am allowed to provide publicly. More information about the project can be found on the [lab's website](https://www.ai2.upv.es/en/proyecto/feroxai-data-and-robotics-technologies-in-harvesting-wild-food/) and the official [project website](https://ferox.fbk.eu/).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use computer vision & machine learning algorithms to enable gesture control on a UAV.
